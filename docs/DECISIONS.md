# Decisions

A running log of significant, auditable technical decisions. Each entry
should record what was decided, why, and what alternatives were considered.

## 2026-07-23 — Project foundation

- **Framework**: Expo (SDK 57) + React Native + TypeScript, using Expo
  Router for file-based navigation. Chosen for a single codebase targeting
  Android and iOS now, with web support available later via the same
  router/config.
- **Language strictness**: TypeScript `strict` mode enabled from the start
  (via `expo/tsconfig.base` plus explicit `strict: true`).
- **Linting**: ESLint flat config (`eslint-config-expo` + `eslint-config-prettier`)
  on ESLint 9, chosen because `eslint-config-expo`'s current dependency tree
  (eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks) is
  not yet compatible with ESLint 10.
- **Import resolution**: `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` pinned to `^4.4.5`
  via an `overrides` entry — the version pulled in transitively by
  `eslint-config-expo` (`^3.6.3`) is incompatible with TypeScript 6.
- **Formatting**: Prettier, run independently of ESLint (`eslint-config-prettier`
  disables stylistic ESLint rules that would conflict with it).
